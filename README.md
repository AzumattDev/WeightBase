 Ship Weight Penalties 
</b></summary>

Ship Weight Penalties<br/>
- What Weight counts?<br/>
  Looks at the weight in the ship's cargo and all the players on the ship.<br/>
- Weight Limit?<br/>
  Weight limit is base on the mass of the ship.<br/>
  You can see a % in the cargo inventory for the % of weight to Max Weight<br/>
- Config Options?<br/>
  You have access to a scale witch scales the mass of the ship up to increase the weight you can have on the ship.<br/>
  You can turn on "Got Weight?" to see when the ship is over weight.<br/>
  You can turn on "Sinking" to have the ship sink if over weight at 150%<br/>
  Also yes you can turn off the weight penalties.<br/>
